[quote]
icon:quote-left[2x] Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

--
* Raise Hand who knows Prettier
* No we have one tool to format all source files
* Prettier can be integrated into maven/gradle as well (but requires node)
--

=== Spring Boot 2.3.x

* Took much longer than expected
* Lot's of combination to test
* Couchbase still not working
* Pending fix in spring data

[.notes]
--
* Valid question why it took so long and why not part of 6.x
* not as easy as updating 1 app to 2.3 as we have much more configurations
* couchbase was the main problem with incompatobilities for e.g. migrations and more
--

=== vue.js

* started as blueprint
* now part of the core generator
* easier to keep up to date

[.notes]
--
* best option imho
* well maintained
* smallest bundle size
* BUT not yet vue3 as 3rd party components not ready yet
--

=== cypress

* protractor did not work well with vue/react
* slow/brittle builds
* cypress is faster & easier 

=== Removed moment.js
